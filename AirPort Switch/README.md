AirPort Switch
====

This is a little neat script to turn off and on Bluetooth and AirPort to get your mac work needing less energy. I made this, as turning both services off and on again should be possible a bit faster, than getting it done by gui.    
I know, that there might be much cleaner ways to get this things done, but at this point my solution works quite good for me. If you have better ideas to contribute, I would be very happy to receive your Pull Requests and even Issues, if you are having some.


What is needed to get this working?
